			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>Include information here about your app.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Instructions for using the app</h3></li>
				<p>I have implemented a 5 key, 3 key and single key interfaces to operate the calculator.</p>
				<p>For the 5 key interface, the following keys resemble the actions
				<ul>
				<li>a - select previous</li>
				<li>d - select next</li>
				<li>s - click selected item</li>
				<li>w - select up</li>
				<li>x - select down</li>
			</ul></p>
				<p>For the 3 key interface, the following keys resemble the actions
				<ul>
				<li>j - select previous</li>
				<li>l - select next</li>
				<li>k - click selected item</li>
			</ul></p>
				<p>For the single key interface, the g key resembles the following actions
				<ul>
				<li>g - select next </li>
				<li>long press on g key - clicks on a selected item</li>
			</ul></p>
				<li><h3>Test Protocol</h3></li>
				<p>My test protocol includes comparing the three built interfaces with each other by conducting three trials for each interface and testing condition, using fingers,
					stylus held in the mouth and the thumb or toe of the foot</p>
				<p>The equations being tested are as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>152 + 87 - 46 = 193</li>
				<li>10 * 4 / 2 = 20</li>
				<li>20 / 5 = 9 - 4 = 9</li>
				<li> 100 * 3 - 47 = 253</li>
				<li>208 / 8 + 72 = 98</li>
			</ul></p>
				<li><h3>Results</h3></li>
				<p> For the 5 key interface the results were as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>Using fingers - For three trials, it took an average time of 2 minutes 16 seconds and 7 total errors</li>
				<li>Using mouth and stylus - For three trials, it took an average time of 4 minutes 18 seconds and 11 total errors</li>
				<li>Using toe - For three trials, it took an average time of 5 minutes 39 seconds and 16 total errors</li>
			</ul></p>
				<p> For the 3 key interface the results were as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>Using fingers - For three trials, it took an average time of 2 minutes 26 seconds and 4 total errors</li>
				<li>Using mouth and stylus - For three trials, it took an average time of 6 minutes 10 seconds and 13 total errors</li>
				<li>Using toe - For three trials, it took an average time of 4 minutes 09 seconds and 9 total errors</li>
			</ul></p>
				<p> For the single key interface the results were as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>Using fingers - For three trials, it took an average time of 4 minutes 14 seconds and 13 total errors</li>
				<li>Using mouth and stylus - For three trials, it took an average time of 6 minutes 37 seconds and 20 total errors</li>
				<li>Using toe - For three trials, it took an average time of 5 minutes 05 seconds and 15 total errors</li>
			</ul></p>

				<li><h3>Conclusion</h3></li>
				<p>I felt that operating a 5 key interface was much easier during the three testing conditions considering the average time
				taken. As the number of keys in the interface are reduced, the difficulty in operating them increases. Considering the number of errors,
				5 key interface has lesser compared to 3 key interface. And single key interface took more time and has more errors compared
				to the other two interfaces.</p>
				<p> Comparing the different testing conditions, using fingers resulted in lesser average time and lesser errors. Mouth and
				 stylus had a longer average time and high number of errors. And toe input method had higher average time and errors compared
				to using fingers as input.</p>
